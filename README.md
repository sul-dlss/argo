# Argo

Argo is the administrative interface to the Stanford Digital Repository.

## Installation

### System Requirements

1. Install Docker
2. Install Ruby 2.6.4

### Check Out the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sul-dlss/argo.git
cd argo
```

### Run bundler to install the Gem dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

Note that `bundle install` may complain if MySQL isn't installed.  You can either comment out the `mysql2` inclusion in `Gemfile` and come back to it later (you can develop using `sqlite3`), or you can install MySQL.

### Install components
## Run the servers

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Need to emulate an administrator role in your browser?  Edit `docker-compose.yml`, and under services:web:environment
change the value of `ROLES` to `sdr:administrator-role`

If you want to use the rails console use:

```
docker-compose run --rm web rails console
```

If you want to run background jobs, which are necessary for spreadsheet bulk uploads and indexing to run:

```
docker-compose run web bin/delayed_job start
```

Note, if you update the Gemfile or Gemfile.lock, you will need to rebuild the web docker container and reload the data:

```
docker-compose build web
docker-compose run --rm web rake argo:repo:load
```

### Note

If you run into errors related to the version of bundler when building the `web` container, that likely means you need to pull a newer copy of the base Ruby image specified in `Dockerfile`, e.g., `docker pull ruby:{MAJOR}.{MINOR}-stretch`.

Also, if you run into webpacker related issues, you may need to manually install yarn and compile webpacker in your Docker container (or local laptop if you running that way):

```
docker-compose run --rm web yarn
docker-compose run --rm web bundle exec rake webpacker:compile
```

## Load and index records

```
docker-compose run --rm web rake argo:repo:load
```


## Common tasks

### Run the tests

To run the test suite, invoke `rspec` from the Argo app root.  Note that the docker containers need to be running already for this work.
```bash
# docker-compose up -d # (if not already running)
rspec
```

### Run the continuous integration build

_Important Note: Running `rake ci` will reload fixtures for the `test` environment only._

The continuous integration build can be run by:
```bash
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake ci
```

### Delete records

You cannot just load records twice and overwrite.  The repo namespace has been provisioned and you need to remove the old record first.

For example, using `rails console` to target one ID, or five:

```ruby
Dor.find("druid:pv820dk6668").destroy
%w[pv820dk6668 rn653dy9317 xb482bw3979 hj185vb7593 hv992ry2431].each{ |pid| Dor.find("druid:#{pid}").destroy }
```

### virtual-merge script

NOTE: temporary until bulk async action implemented in UI

Merges multiple image objects into a parent object via virtual object structure (e.g. an atlas in which each map has been individually cataloged).  Creates a virtual composite object with contentMD pointing to binaries held in other objects; the child objects have an isConstituentOf element in RELS-EXT allowing traversal to a parent object in discovery interfaces.

virtual merge can be run from the Argo application root directory:

```bash
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec ./bin/virtual-merge --purge druid:pp000pp0000 druid:cc111cc1111 druid:cc222cc2222
```

where `pp000pp0000` is the druid for the virtual composite object and the child objects are `cc111cc1111` and `cc222cc2222`.  More info, including object requirements: <https://consul.stanford.edu/display/chimera/Virtual+Object+Combinator+I>

For help:

```bash
bundle exec ./bin/virtual-merge -h
```

## Internals

Argo uses Blacklight and ActiveFedora to expose the repository contents, and `dor-services` to enable editing and updating. Its key components include:

- Rails 5.1
- Blacklight 6
- dor-services
  - ActiveFedora
  - dor-workflow-service
- RSolr
- DelayedJob
- Bootstrap
- JQuery

and in development or testing mode:

- RSpec
- Capybara
- Chrome

## Further reading

### Indexing (including bulk reindexing)

For further reading on how indexing from Fedora to Solr works in Argo, see [INDEXING.md](INDEXING.md).  This explains how single object reindexing works, how the bulk reindexing mechanism works, and how to build custom reindexing runs.

### Profiling

For information on how to profile the app in the event of performance issues, see [PROFILING.md](PROFILING.md).  This explains how to collect profiling info, how to analyze it, how to approach the issue generally, and alternatives/complements to Argo's main built-in profiling tool.
