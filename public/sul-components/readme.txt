This is the styles from sul-dlss/component-library.

This was installed by copying the styles directory from https://github.com/sul-dlss/component-library/releases/tag/v2024-08-07

You should no edit these files directly, but instead edit in the component-library repository, then cut a release and then move the release in here.

Ideally this would be deployed to a sul styles asset server and we could just reference it.
